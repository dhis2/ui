# Alert bar

An alert bar communicates something to the user by showing a prominent, floating bar at the bottom of the screen, using one of several styles each indicating a different purpose.

<Demo>
    <AlertBar permanent>Hello world</AlertBar>
</Demo>

## Usage

:::caution Usage Notice
Usage of the AlertBar component is not recommended when using the Application Platform, as integration is already implemented directly.
:::

In apps using the App Platform, itâ€™s recommended to use the `useAlert()` hook from the `@dhis2/app-runtime` library instead of using the UI components directly, since an Alerts Manager component is already set up to manage showing, hiding, and stacking alerts.

When passing the options object to the `useAlert(message, options)` hook, the keys and value types of the options are the same as the props of the `AlertBar` component, as documented on this page below, e.g.

```jsx
import { useAlert } from '@dhis2/app-runtime'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { show } = useAlert('Hello', {
        warning: true,
        duration: 15000,
        actions: [
            { label: 'Hi!', onClick: () => alert('Hi!') },
            { label: 'Bye!', onClick: () => alert('Bye!') },
        ],
    })

    // ...later:
    show()

    // ...
}
```

Read more about the `useAlert()` hook at the [App Runtime documentation](https://developers.dhis2.org/docs/app-runtime/hooks/useAlert)

### When to use

-   **Tell the user about something important**. Alert bars should only be used for information the user needs to know about.
-   **To inform without blocking**. An alert bar doesn't block the rest of the page, so it should be used to communicate when the user doesn't need to be pulled out of a workflow.
-   **Confirm important actions**. A successful alert bar can tell the user that something was saved successfully without stopping them from moving on.

### When not to use

-   **Critical, blocking problems**. An alert bar can be ignored, so it shouldn't be used if a problem is blocking the user's workflow.
-   **Unnecessary information**. Alert bars will grab the user's attention and distract them from their work, so only use them to communicate important information, problems, and confirmations.

### Variants

#### Quick reference

| Variant    | When to use                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`     | Default. Communicate something that's isn't positive or negative.       |
| `success`  | Confirm an important successful action.                                 |
| `warning`  | Warn of a potential problem, usually before it happens.                 |
| `critical` | Communicate a catastrophic error, failure, or problem after it happens. |

#### Info

<Demo>
    <AlertBar permanent>Data export complete.</AlertBar>
</Demo>

```jsx
<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar permanent>Data export complete.</AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```

-   An `info` alert bar is the default. Use it if none of the other variants fit.
-   Automatically dismiss after 5 seconds, so the message should be a useful but not critical.
-   Use for minor positive confirmations, like _Sharing settings changed._
-   Don't use for errors or problems.

#### Success

<Demo>
    <AlertBar success permanent>1000 objects updated.</AlertBar>
</Demo>

```jsx
<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar success permanent>
        1000 objects updated.
    </AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```

-   Only use to confirm successful, major actions.
-   Don't use for minor confirmations or navigation movements.
-   Always tell the user what was successful. Use clear labels like _45 units updated_, rather than just _Updated_.

#### Warning

<Demo>
    <AlertBar warning permanent>Some data is taking a long time to sync.</AlertBar>
</Demo>

```jsx
<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar warning permanent>
        Some data is taking a long time to sync.
    </AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```

-   Use to warn of potential problems or things that might happen, like _Some data is taking a long time to sync_.
-   Show before the problem happens, if possible.
-   If a problem has already happened, use a `critical` variant instead.
-   Won't automatically dismiss until the warning conditions change, like when the loading finishes.

#### Critical

<Demo>
    <AlertBar critical permanent>There was a problem loading this dashboard.</AlertBar>
</Demo>

```jsx
<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar critical permanent>
        There was a problem loading this dashboard.
    </AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```

-   Only use to communicate a serious problem, like broken functionality or a failed process.
-   Use when a user can still interact with the page. If the entire page broken, use a [`Modal`](modal.md) dialog or error screen instead.
-   Communicate clearly what happened. Use labels like _There was a problem loading this dashboard_ or _Message failed to send_.
-   Won't automatically dismiss.

### Format

#### Content

-   Alert bar labels should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Remember, `info` and `success` alert bars dismiss automatically.
-   Don't use unclear labels like _Success_, _Failed_, or vague descriptions like _There was a problem_. Be clear and precise.
-   Check the [A-Z glossary](../patterns/glossary.md) and [communication guidelines](../principles/content-communication.md) for more tips for writing useful labels.

#### Display

-   Several alert bars can be shown at the same time.
-   Alert bars are automatically shown in the correct size and spacings when using an [`AlertStack`](https://ui.dhis2.nu/demo/?path=/story/feedback-alerts-alert-stack--default).

## Options

### Actions

<Demo>
    <AlertBar actions
={[
                {
                    label: 'Save',
                },
                {
                    label: 'Cancel',
                }
            ]} permanent>Hello world</AlertBar>
</Demo>

```jsx
<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar
        actions={[
            {
                label: 'Save',
                onClick: clickHandler,
            },
            {
                label: 'Cancel',
                onClick: clickHandler,
            },
        ]}
        permanent
    >
        Hello world
    </AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```

-   Alert bars can have up to two optional actions.
-   Actions offer a shortcut to act on the information in the alert bar.
-   Actions can do something on the current page, like _Retry_ for a failed action.
-   Actions can navigate somewhere else, like _View documentation_. Open external navigation in new tabs so the user doesn't lose their working context.
-   Only show simple actions. Don't include complex actions or actions with several steps.

### Icon

-   Each variant shows a default icon to support the content being communicated.
-   A custom icon can be used. Only use icons that are relevant to the content and that help the user understand the context. Use the default icon unless there's a good reason not to.

## Using AlertStack

As you can see with all the demo's above, we've used the `AlertStack` component to render the `AlertBar` component. This is because the `AlertStack` component is responsible for positioning the `AlertBar` component in relation to other `AlertBar`s. Especially when there are multiple `AlertBar` components on the page, the `AlertStack` component will make sure that they are stacked on top of each other and that they are not overlapping. It is therefore recommended to always use the `AlertStack` component when using the `AlertBar` component.

To use the `AlertStack` component, you can simply wrap your `AlertBar` component in the `AlertStack` component. The `AlertStack` component will then take care of the positioning.

```jsx
import { AlertStack, AlertBar } from '@dhis2/ui'
;<AlertStack>
    <AlertBar>...</AlertBar>
    <AlertBar>...</AlertBar>
    <AlertBar>...</AlertBar>
</AlertStack>
```
