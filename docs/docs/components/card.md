# Card

A card is a container element used to group together and separate blocks of content.

<Demo
    path="card--default"
    args="children:Card Content."
    height="150px"
/>

## Usage

```jsx
<Card>Card Content.</Card>
```

### When to use

-   **Group content**. Use a card as a container for related content. When there's different areas of content on a page, a card helps to establish boundaries between them.

### When not to use

-   **Few items**. A card probably isn't necessary to contain one or two items. Everything on a page doesn't need to be wrapped in a card.
