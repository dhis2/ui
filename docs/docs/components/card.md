# Card

A card is a container element used to group together and separate blocks of content.

<Demo>
    <Card>This is content that's inside a card.</Card>
</Demo>

## Usage

### When to use

-   **Group content**. Use a card as a container for related content. When there's different areas of content on a page, a card helps to establish boundaries between them.

### When not to use

-   **Few items**. A card probably isn't necessary to contain one or two items. Everything on a page doesn't need to be wrapped in a card.
