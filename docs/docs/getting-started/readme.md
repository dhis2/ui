# About DHIS2 UI

DHIS2 UI is an open source design system for building DHIS2 apps. The system is based on a foundation of principles, patterns, and guidelines for designing user-friendly apps. A reusable component library provides the building blocks to develop DHIS2 apps with consistent user experience.

## Design approach

DHIS2 UI is based on the concept of atomic design. The most basic components, atoms, are used to build more complex components: molecules and organisms. Atomic components allow flexibility in the face of the unknown. Our components can't solve every use case that DHIS2 apps cover. By exposing components at the atomic level, developers can compose their own solutions from atomic components to solve specific use cases.

The atomic design approach is inspired by [the work of Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/).
