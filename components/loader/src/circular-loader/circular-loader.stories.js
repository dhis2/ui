Use loading indicators whenever a component or application takes longer than 700ms to load. After this time a loader should be displayed so that the user can understand what is happening: loading is in progress. Consider that without a loading indicator a user would be unsure of their current status, so they are important UI elements.

A circular loader is used when the loading time is uncertain and cannot be displayed as a percentage. A circular loader can spin many times, and each spin does not represent any amount of completion.
