Use a notice box wherever there is important, temporary information about a page or situation that the user needs to be aware of.

Notice boxes are different from alert bars in several ways. Notice boxes cannot be dismissed, so they will always display until the situation is resolved. Notice boxes are for highlighting static information or information that is ongoing. Alert bars are suited to alerting a user about something that has just happened.

Another way to decide which component to use:

- a notice box will usually be displayed when a page loads, before a user takes action
- an alert bar will usually display in response to an action/event

Notice boxes cannot be dismissed, so it is important to provide guidance on how to fix the problem/condition that is causing the notice box to display.

Do not use a notice box to display permanent information. If there is information that always will be displayed on a page it should be designed as part of the page itself. Notice boxes are for temporary information.
