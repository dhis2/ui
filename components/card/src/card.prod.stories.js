A card is a container element for grouping together
and separating blocks of content.
`

const description = `
Use a card where there is content that can be grouped together.
Cards are most often useful when this grouped content may be repeated,
for example with items on a dashboard, or different sections of patient
information displayed in a profile.

Note that it requires a parent, like [Box](../?path=/docs/layout-box--default), to define its size.
